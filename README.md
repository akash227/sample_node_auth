# sample_node_auth

This is a sample application to illustrate how to build a Node.js login page
using passport and passport-local npm modules.

A login username and password of same value would make the app working. This logic here is just to stimulate the actual process.

There is no need for explicit code for performing validations of user input since mongoose takes care of it.

Here we have secured our app using ssl.
